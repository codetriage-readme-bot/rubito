# Rubito

## What's rubito?

Rubito is a programming language written in Python and inspired by Ruby, Crystal and Python. It's aimed for simplicity and intuitivity. Rubito programs can be executed from (both rubito itself and executable files(.rbt/.rbtx)).

## When it's out?

It should be out pretty soon.

## But wait, where should I edit the rubito code?

I'll be happy to receive help on writing syntax highlighters/extensions to modern IDEs and/or text editors.

As of 28.10.2016 the sources are located right here, in this repository. Please keep in mind the instability of the language and language internals. Everything is subject to change.

### btw, Help wanted
